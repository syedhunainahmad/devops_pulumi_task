Getting Started — Pulumi (GCP, JavaScript)
=========================================

This is a minimal Pulumi JavaScript program that provisions a Google Cloud Storage bucket. It follows the "Pulumi with GCP and JavaScript" portion of the tutorial.

What this repo contains
- `index.js` — Pulumi program creating a GCS bucket and exporting its URL.
- `Pulumi.yaml` / `Pulumi.dev.yaml` — Pulumi project and stack metadata.

Quick setup & run
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd getting-started
npm run install-deps
```

2. Set stack config (replace with real values):

```bash
pulumi stack select dev
pulumi config set gcp:project YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID --stack dev
pulumi config set gcp:region YOUR_GCP_REGION --stack dev
```

3. Authenticate with GCP. Choose one:
- Recommended (user ADC):

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

- Or: create a service account key JSON and export it:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/path/to/sa-key.json"
```

4. Preview the changes (safe):

```bash
npm run pulumi:preview
```

5. Create the resources interactively:

```bash
npm run pulumi:up
```

Notes
- I added placeholder config values in the `dev` stack earlier so no resources were created yet. Replace placeholders with your real project/region before `pulumi up`.
- This repo intentionally does not contain any service-account JSON files. Do not commit secrets into git.

Troubleshooting
- If `pulumi preview` or `pulumi up` fails due to authentication, ensure `gcloud` is installed and you ran the ADC command, or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a valid service account key file path.
- If you want me to run `pulumi preview`/`up` from here, provide the authentication choice and the real project/region values (or run the steps locally).

More
- To follow the full video tutorial, watch the "Pulumi with GCP and JavaScript" chapter (around 36:18) and iterate from this minimal example.
